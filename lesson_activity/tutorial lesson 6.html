<h5><font face=Tahoma>The first characters is call Bai Xing. Bai Xing turns out to be a star that emits white light. She appears in every quiet night. 
    Bai Xing likes to fly freely in the night sky. You may see a white stream of light flying by, which is the footprint she left. 
    Ignorant girls will also sneak into people's dreams when they are asleep. Those strange and bizarre dreams are like gorgeous rainbows, 
    allowing Bai Xing to begin to understand the world a little bit, it turns out that there are such beautiful colors.
    But occasionally, dreams will be of unknown colors and dominated by a depressing atmosphere. At this time, the girl will use her unique "power", 
    and Bai Xing will collect these unpleasant dreams into her wishing bottle, and those uneasy and restless dreams will be stored in her wishing bottle. 
    In the end, they will all turn into lively stars and return to peace. In the world in Bai Xing's eyes, warm colors will once again dominate this dream. 
    In this way, day after day, year after year, in the lonely night, there are still good dreams accompanying her.

<h6><font face=Tahoma>The characters is call Kroos. As early as when the mainland had not yet taken shape, a group of gods had already been born. They each performed their own duties, 
    and the world that runs today was created. Kroos is life bred in the torrent of time, a god born from time and order.
    From the moment Kroos gained consciousness, he was in the desolation, and the only thing accompanying him was the "Wheel of Time" 
    that emerged from the desolation. The clock that coexists with the sky and the earth records everything left by the years. 
    When Kroos touched this clock, he saw the vast galaxy, and the stars surrounding him were the rapid passage of time. During this period of time, 
    life was born from the desolation, and Kroos watched the emergence of civilization. The stardust he picked up casually recorded one story after another.
